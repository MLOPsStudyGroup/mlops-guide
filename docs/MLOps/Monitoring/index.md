# Continuos Monitoring
Once a model has been deployed, it needs to be monitored to assure that not only it performs as expected but it is also necessary to emphasize the importance of monitoring models in production to avoid discriminatory behavior on the part of predictive models. This type of behavior occurs in such a way that an arbitrary group of people is privileged at the expense of others and is usually an unintended result of how the data is collected, selected and used to train the models. 



 Therefore, the tool validates, tests and monitors models to ensure their best performance, in addition to mitigating regulatory, reputation and operational risks.
